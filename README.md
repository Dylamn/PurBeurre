## Overview
...

## Installation
This application needs the `...` modules installed. To do that, you must the module via pip. I recommend to use a
virtual environment. You can either use the integrated library [venv](https://docs.python.org/3.8/library/venv.html) 
since python 3.3, [virtualenv](https://virtualenv.pypa.io/en/latest/) or any tool you want.

For example with venv, you can create and activate with the following:
```shell script
$ python3 -m venv venv
$ source venv/bin/activate
```

After you have created your virtual environment and activate it, use the following command to install dependencies:

```shell script
$ python3 -m pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Run the application
After the ... package(s) installation, you can run the application by executing 
the entry point which is the `main.py` file at the root of the project.
You must run the file as a script with the python interpreter:

```shell script
$ python3 main.py
```
